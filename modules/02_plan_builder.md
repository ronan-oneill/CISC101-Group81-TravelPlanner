Module 2 — Plan Builder (Options → Days)

Change Log (2025-11-11): Expanded daily planning logic to include activity selection order, proximity rules, pacing balance, and flexibility guidelines. Refined wording for readability and future scalability.

Start by generating a short, structured list of possible activities. Each entry should include:

Type (attraction, restaurant, park, event)

Estimated duration (in hours)

Cost range

Distance from the previous location or lodging

Then, build daily itineraries using a clean loop that balances proximity, variety, and pacing:

for each day:
1. Select a Morning activity near lodging to minimize early travel.
2. Choose a Midday activity close to the morning one for convenience.
3. Add an Afternoon activity with a different theme (e.g., outdoor after indoor).
4. End with an Evening restaurant or optional cultural event near lodging.

Guidelines to keep days realistic and engaging:

Keep total active time around 6–8 hours.

Alternate indoor and outdoor themes where possible.

Avoid repeating similar types of activities across consecutive days.

Ensure at least one flexible “swap” option per day in case of weather or timing issues.
